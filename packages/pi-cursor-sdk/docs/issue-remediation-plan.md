# Open Issue Remediation Plan

Captured 2026-05-23 from GitHub issues on `fitchmultz/pi-cursor-sdk`.

## Open issues inventory

| Issue | Title | Severity | Status in this PR |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| #17 | Weird prints (ripgrep / ignore mapping SDK noise) | User-facing TUI corruption | Fixed |
| #19 | Consolidate edit diff fallback | Maintainability | Fixed |
| #20 | Stale pi 0.75.3 in investigation doc | Docs hygiene | Fixed |
| #21 | Decompose 1k+ line modules | Structural debt | Fixed |

Closed issues (#1, #2, #13, #15) were already remediated on `main`; no action required.

## Remediation approach

### #17 — Ripgrep / ignore-mapping TUI noise

**Root cause:** `@cursor/sdk` emits stderr/console errors when ripgrep is not configured (`Error initializing ignore mapping for .gitignore`, `Ripgrep path not configured`). These lines were not covered by the existing integrator-noise filter (same class as #13 `[hooks]` noise).

**Fix:** Extend `src/cursor-sdk-output-filter.ts` startup-noise patterns; keep filter installed for the full provider turn.

**Follow-up (not blocking):** `@cursor/sdk` does not export `configureRipgrepPath()`; if SDK adds a public ripgrep bootstrap API, wire absolute `rg` path resolution at extension startup.

### #19 — Canonical edit diff resolver

**Fix:** Add `src/cursor-edit-diff.ts` with ordered fallback `diffString → diff → unifiedDiff → patch`. Use from `cursor-native-tool-display.ts` and `cursor-tool-transcript.ts`. Unit tests in `test/cursor-edit-diff.test.ts`.

### #20 — Investigation doc version drift

**Fix:** Mark `docs/investigations/token-tracking-session-2026-05-21.md` as a point-in-time record (2026-05-21, pi 0.75.3) and note current dev baseline 0.75.5.

### #21 — Module decomposition

Split by ownership boundary (behavior-preserving moves):

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `cursor-provider.ts` (~1276) | `cursor-provider.ts` (~369) + `cursor-provider-live-run-drain.ts` (~374) + `cursor-provider-turn-coordinator.ts` (~402) + `cursor-partial-content-emitter.ts` (~121) + `cursor-sdk-output-filter.ts` (~78) |
| `cursor-tool-transcript.ts` (~1264) | orchestrator (~28) + `cursor-transcript-tool-specs.ts` (~441) + `cursor-transcript-utils.ts` + `cursor-transcript-tool-formatters.ts` + `cursor-sensitive-text.ts` |
| `cursor-pi-tool-bridge.ts` (~1174) | main (~852) + `cursor-pi-tool-bridge-diagnostics.ts` + `cursor-pi-tool-bridge-mcp.ts` + `cursor-pi-tool-bridge-types.ts` + `cursor-record-utils.ts` |
| `test/cursor-provider.test.ts` (~5151) | scenario-focused test files + `test/helpers/cursor-provider-harness.ts` (stream/bridge/replay splits, each ≤800 lines) |

## Phase 2 completion

Follow-up issues #23/#24/#25 were completed after the phase-1 remediation PR:

- #23 — `cursor-pi-tool-bridge.ts` was split into bridge snapshot/server/run/abort/diagnostics/MCP/types modules.
- #24 — `cursor-native-tool-display.ts` was split into state/registration/replay/tools modules.
- #25 — Cursor SDK tool completion routing was centralized through `CursorSdkTurnCoordinator.resolveToolCompletion`.

## Validation

- `npm test`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm pack --dry-run`
- Before any Cursor provider/runtime release, follow the full live smoke gate in `docs/cursor-live-smoke-checklist.md`.

## Issue closure mapping

The phase-1 remediation PR closed #17, #19, #20, and #21. The phase-2 follow-up PRs closed #23, #24, and #25.
